# VBA-stocks
Started work by modifying the VBA file from class activity 2.3.6 Credit Card Checker

Note – in the Challenge2 directions, the sample image does not include coloring of the “Percent Change” column but coloring of that column is listed as a required in the grading guidance.  I included conditional formatting of “Percent Change” in my script and screenshots.

Working with Tutor (Kourt Bailey).  He had numerous suggestions about my script including:
Cleaning up the code and removing redundant values
When a command line is used more than twice, to define it, and use that
Defining my colors as a constant for the conditional formatting
Removing redundancy in how I was calculating the total volume
Guidance on the cycling through all the worksheets
Organizing the code as Input, Calculation, then Output
Inclusion of the MsgBox as a check on counting of rows and completion, which I left in the script.
